    "* Third, determine whether the influential observation is valid, and only unusual. If you had a larger sample size, there might be more observations that are similar to the unusual one. You might need to collect more data to confirm the relationship that's suggested by the influential observation.\n",
    "* As a general rule, you should not exclude data. In many circumstances, some of the unusual observations contain important information.

As part of your report or presentation, you should discuss the limitation of your conclusions, given the exclusions.\n",

Collinearity, also called multicollinearity, is a potential problem in multiple regression. It occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "Because collinearity involving several predictors can be missed by correlations, we need additional tools for collinearity detection such as Variance Inflation Factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collinearity doesn't violate the assumptions of multiple regression. It means that there's redundant information among the predictor variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing Collinearity\n",
    "You've seen that when variables are collinear, one of the variables provides nearly the same information as the other. X1 and X2 are collinear, so they follow a reasonably straight line. When the model includes both variables, neither one might be significant. However, when the model includes only one of them, either variable might be significant. This means that collinearity can hide significant effects, and this is a good reason to deal with collinearity before using any automated model selection tool. Second, collinearity increases the variance of the parameter estimates, which make them unstable. In turn, this increases the prediction error of the model\n",
    "This isn't an uncommon occurrence and illustrates an important point. If a composite variable is included in a model along with some or all of its component measures, there's bound to be collinearity. If the composite variable has meaning, it can be used as a substitute measure for both components, \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### variance inflation factor (VIF)\n",
    "the important thing to remember is the approximate cutoff value. If the VIF is greater than 10 for any predictors in the model, those predictors are likely involved in collinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using an Effective Modeling Cycle\n",
    "Now that you have a solid understanding of developing good regression models for your data, let's take a moment to review what you know about effective modeling.\n",

    "* First, you want to get to know your data by performing preliminary analyses. You should plot your data, calculate descriptive statistics, and perform correlation analysis.\n",

    "* Second, it's a good idea to check for collinearity before using any automated model selection techniques. This step can include the use of the correlation analyses and VIF statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Third, you use PROC REG or PROC GLMSELECT to identify some good candidate models. No perfect model exists, so find the best, or simply, the most useful one. To narrow your choices to a few good models, you can use all-possible regressions if you have few candidate predictors, or stepwise selection methods when you consider many predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fourth is verifying model assumptions and searching for possible influential observations. You need to check and validate your assumptions by creating plots of residuals, and graphs of the residuals versus predicted values and predictors. To detect influential observations, you examine the RSTUDENT residuals, Cook's D statistic, DFFITS, and DFBETAS statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fifth, you need to revise your model if needed. If Steps 3 and 4 indicate the need for model revision, generate a new model by returning to these two steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The last step is prediction testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should try to validate your model with a holdout data set not used to build the model to see whether it generalizes well to new data sets. You'll learn about prediction testing, and predictive modeling in general, in the next lesson, when we move from inference to prediction."

    "## 6. Model Building for Scoring and Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Introduction to Predictive Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predictive Modeling Terminology\n",
    "**The goal** of predictive modeling is to predict, or score, future values of a target variable based on the existing values of inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process: \n",
    "* begins with partitioning a data set into separate training and validation data sets. \n",
    "* The model is built using the training data and then assessed using the validation data. \n",
    "* After a best model is chosen, the model is deployed to make predictions on new data using a process called scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictor variables: \n",
    "* inputs, features, explanatory variables, or independent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The response variables: \n",
    "* targets, outcomes or dependent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The observations: \n",
    "* cases, instances or records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement scale and variable type of the inputs and targets can be varied across different applications. They can be continuous variables  and categorical variables. They are often binary variables,. \n",
    "\n",
    "A predictive model consists of either a formula or rules, depending on the type of analysis that you use. \n",
    "**Formulas**: regression models, ... which are parametric and have formulas. \n",
    "**Rules** nonparametric models such as decision trees and random forests, which predict new cases based on a sequence of decisions, or rules, based on the values of the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Complexity\n",
    "A model with just enough complexity, which also means just enough flexibility, gives the best generalization to new data sets. The important concept is that there isn't one perfect model. There's always a balance between overfitting and underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting:  An overly complex model might be too flexible, accommodating nuances of the random noise or the chance relationships in the sample. Overfitting leads to models that have higher variance when they are applied to a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting: an insufficiently complex model might not be flexible enough. This leads to underfitting. That is, systematically missing the signal, and underfitting leads to biased predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building a Predictive Model\n",
    "The first part of the predictive modeling process is model building. You start by fitting a variety of models, and then you assess their performance and select the best model. You want to select a model that generalizes well that is, the model that's flexible enough to accurately predict new data. The key is to not overfit the training data set. The classic example of overfitting is selecting linear regression models based on R-square because the R-square metric improves or fits the model at least as well each time a predictor is added to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you select the best model?\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the chosen model generalizes well, you use honest assessment, where you perform the assessment on a different data set than the one you use to build the model. Partitioning the data enables you to train the model and assess its performance on new cases. Using honest assessment, you partition or split the available data into a data set for training, and one for validation, and sometimes a third data set for testing. All partitions contain the predictors and the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data set is used to fit a variety of different models. The validation data set is a holdout sample that's used to compare model performance and select the best performing model. Using a holdout sample is a way of assessing how well the models generalize to new data. If created, the test data set is used to give a final honest estimate of generalization for the chosen model. In practice, many analysts see no need for a final assessment. Instead, the model assessment measured on the validation data is reported as an upper bound on the performance that is expected when the model is deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there's no globally optimal percentage to use when you partition the data. Common partitions include 70% training and 30% validation, or an 80/20 split, or 90/10 split, but the decision is the responsibility of the analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive modeling is typically used when we have very large data sets and partitioning the data enables us to still build models on an adequate amount of data. However, if you start with a small or medium-size data set, partitioning the data might not be efficient, because the reduced sample size can severely degrade the fit of the model. In fact, computer-intensive methods, such as cross validation were developed so that all the data can be used for both fitting and honest assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Assessment and Selection\n",
    "During the model fitting phase of predictive modeling, you use the training data to create a variety of different models, and possibly use several model selection methods. In this example, we'll use the forward selection method to generate several candidate models. In forward selection, variables are added into the model as long as they meet the criterion for inclusion. For example, with the AICC criterion, variables will be added as long as the criterion value continues to decrease. When the value can no longer be reduced, indicating that the model can no longer be improved, the process stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here five possible models of increasing complexity were generated. For simplicity, the complexity of each model is indicated by a number from 1 to 5. Next, the validation data is used to assess the performance of each model. These performance measures are then used as the criteria for selecting the best model. In this simplified example, a star rating indicates how well the model fits the validation data. The validation assessment rating ranges from one star to three stars. Model 1 received a one-star rating, models 2 and 5 received two stars, and models 3 and 4 received three stars, indicating that they are the best models. But what if you need to choose only one?\n",
    "\n",
    "When there's a tie or a near tie, the most parsimonious model is typically chosen in other words, the simplest model with the highest validation assessment. Recall that, in this example, the models are listed in order of increasing complexity.This means that model 3 is simpler than model 4, so you choose model 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preparing for Scoring\n",
    "Before you start using a newly built model to score data, some preparation of the data might be required. For example, in database target marketing, the data to be scored might be many times larger than the data that is used to develop the model, and it might be stored in a different format. It's essential for the scoring data to be comparable to the training and validation data that were used to build the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any modifications were made to the data before the model was built and validated, then the same modifications must be made to the scoring data before scoring. This might include missing value imputation, transformations, and derivation of inputs through standardization or the creation of composite variables from existing variables. This is essential for the deployed model to be able to map the scoring functionality to the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making the same modifications becomes more complex if the original modifications were based on parameters that were derived from the training data set, such as the mean or standard deviation. This means that if you subtracted the mean of a variable from the training and validation data, then the mean of that variable should also be subtracted from the scoring data. This practice keeps the different data sets comparable. The process of preparing the data for scoring can be time- and resource-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods of Scoring\n",
    "When scoring, you don't rerun the algorithm that was used to build the model. Instead, you apply the score code, that is, the equations or rules obtained from the final model, to the new data. Let's look at three methods of scoring your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first uses a SCORE statement in PROC GLMSELECT to build and score a model in one step. This method is inefficient if you want to score more than once or use a large data set to build a model, because the model must be built from the training data each time the program is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method uses a STORE statement in PROC GLMSELECT to build an item store, and a SCORE statement in PROC PLM. With this method, you build the model and an item store only once, and then access the item store in PROC PLM to score new data as often as needed. Separating the model building from scoring is especially helpful if your model is based on a very large training data set or if you want to score more than once. One potential problem with this method is that others might not be able to use this code with earlier versions of SAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third method uses a STORE statement in PROC GLMSELECT to build an item store, a CODE statement in PROC PLM to generate scoring code based on the item store, and a DATA step to run the scoring code. The resulting code is compatible with earlier versions of SAS, and you can share it with others without needing to share the item store."

The Spearman correlation is a rank correlation, because it provides a degree of association between the ranks, or the levels, of the ordinal variables. This statistic has a range between -1 and 1. Values close to 1 indicate that there’s a relatively high degree of positive correlation. Values close to -1 indicate that there’s a relatively high degree of negative correlation. And values close to 0 indicate a weak correlation.\n",
